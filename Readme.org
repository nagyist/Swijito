* Swijito
** A  Apple iCloud Photostream Client in Swift
   
[[file:image.png]]
   
This is a simple client that allows you to view people's iCloud shared photo streams in an app on your Mac instead of having to open a browser for them. This is a very early relese, it lacks a ton of functionality.

I've created it because I needed a simple non-toy project to improve my Swift knowledge. After going back and forth between different ideas, I decided to implement this, because it is something that I'd actually like to use myself

* Status
- This exists mainly to educate myself about Swift. Thus, the Swift code quality is currently sub par, as I'm trying to figure it out.
- I plan to continously update this and refactor the Swift code to be better encapsulated, abstracted, and cleaner
- Currently, not all streams load. Some just return zero data, even though the requests match their browser counterparts. I'm still investigating this
- Very limited UI
- Can't like or interact with an image
- Only loads the full quality images, does not load the previews
- Currently no support for video files (half done though)
- This is more or less a learning project and not production quality code, so it lacks unit tests
  
* Usage

If you add an account, you have to add the account id. I.e. in the following iCloud stream:
#+BEGIN_SRC Sh
https://www.icloud.com/photostream/#ANJtdd8978987s
#+END_SRC

then =ANJtdd8978987s= would be the account id that you need to enter into the =Add= dialog.


* Todo
Where to begin? :)
- Load previews
- Add icon view
- Fix the bug that causes some streams to not load
- Add support for liking items
- Add support for commenting on items
- Improve UI
- Refactor Swift Code
- Addd nice icon
- Finish the work on video files
- Add unit tests

* Notes
- "Kijito" means "Stream" in Swahili
- Swi-jito is then the Swifting Stream
